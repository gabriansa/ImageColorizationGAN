# Grayscale Image Colorization using GANs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on colorizing grayscale images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically implementing Pix2Pix architecture. We utilize the CIFAR-10 dataset, TensorFlow, Keras, and Python for this task.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the GAN models.
- Pix2Pix GAN architecture, incorporating U-Net and PatchGAN.
- CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.
- Python for scripting and data preprocessing.

## Model Architecture
- U-Net based generator model.
- PatchGAN based discriminator model.
- Binary Cross-Entropy for loss calculation.
- Adam optimizer for both generator and discriminator.
